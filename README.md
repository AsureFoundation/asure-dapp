## Project Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AsureFoundation/asure-dapp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AsureFoundation/asure-dapp)

This implementation is still very much a work in progress. It can be used for testing,
but it should not be used for real funds. We do our best to identify and fix problems,
and implement missing features.

Any help testing the implementation, reporting bugs, or helping with outstanding issues
is very welcome.
